# Clustering

This repository consists the codes of all my work related to clustering. You will find three folders in this repository named as:

1. Bank Marketing campaign
2. Insurance
3. Reviews for recommender system

In each of these files, both the methods i.e., Hierarchical and Non-hierarchical clustering have been used.
