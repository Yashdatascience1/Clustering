## Problem Statement

Review ratings by 5456 travelers (Users) on 24 tourist attractions across various sites in Europe
are considered. This data is the primary input for an automatic recommender system. Each
reviewer (User) has rated various attractions, such as churches, resorts, bakeries etc. and the
given ratings are all between 0 (lowest) and 5 (highest). Objective is to partition the sample of
travelers into clusters, so that tailored recommendations may be made for next travel
destinations.

**Objective** was to cluster the Users into mutually exclusive groups according to their
preferences for various tourist attractions.

## Conclusion of the study

1. Users were partitioned into 12 clusters
2. Cluster 1 and Cluster 11 have given very high ranking to Restaurants whereas Clusters 0, 6 and especially 8 have given low ranking to Fast
Food. It is clear that users belonging to Cluster 8 are discriminatory eaters and information about fast food
to these users will not be useful at all
3. Compared to them, preference of Cluster 3 shows high ranks in Lodging and Fast Food but medium rank in Restaurant. 
It is possible that these users are more convenience loving and information about good accommodation and perhaps near-by fast food joints will be
appreciated by this group
